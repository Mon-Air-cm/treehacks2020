# treehacks2020

Waste management suite designed to make sustainability efforts seamless for both the public and administration. The hub is a two part modular attachment that can convert and trashcan to an automated sustainable one. 

Our module uses CV to classify trash as Landfill, Compost or Recyclable materials and opens the correct lid to make it effortless for users to classify their trash.

Another thing we do is monitor trash levels and send them to a web server where they are accumulated onto a dashboard for easy monitoring for the administration managing the trash cans. We used the Python Flask module to build the web server. 

This project was given special recognition by nVidia at TreeHacks 2020.
